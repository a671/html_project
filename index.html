        <p>This picture above really describes a whole lot about myself.</p>
        My favorite sport is soccer.</p>
        I have been playing for over 18 years. Every since I kicked a ball I never stoped.</p>
        I would practice/train 4 hours a day.</p>
        My father was one of my highest motavation to continue this sport.</p>
