        <p>This picture was taken my last year of High School. It was given to me on the day my school had 
            rewards night for all seniors. I am not going to lie. I never thought I would come this far knowing 
            that I made a huge impacted to my school. Winning finals. Always helping my teamates out. Without my family 
            or my coaches I dont know how I would have taken all those rewards.
