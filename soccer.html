    <p>These are some pictures of me playing for Huntly High School. I actually never went to Huntly. I went to
        Marengo Community High School. One day, I got a call from the Huntly soccer coach. He told me if 
        I would be able to play some games with there team, and of course I said yes. My qoute is if you have the 
        opportunity to learn more go for it, so I did. After I did that I am going to say that I learned a lot with 
        their team. I even became friends with mostly all of them. Until this day I still talk to them.
